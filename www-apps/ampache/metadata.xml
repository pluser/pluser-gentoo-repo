<longdescription>Ampache is a web based audio/video streaming application and file manager allowing you to access your music and videos from anywhere, using almost any internet enabled device.

Ampache's usefulness is heavily dependent on being able to extract correct metadata from embedded tags in your files and/or the filename. Ampache is not a media organiser; it is meant to be a tool which presents an already organised collection in a useful way. It assumes that you know best how to manage your files and are capable of choosing a suitable method for doing so.</longdescription>
